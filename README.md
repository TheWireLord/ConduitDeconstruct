# Conduit Deconstruct Mod
This mod was designed to help those players, like myself, that find it annoying to have to deconstruct a single power conduit at a time. With this mod you will be able to not only view your entire power grid, but also designate mass amounts of conduits to be deconstructed at once. It is a very simple concept that I believe will be very useful to players out there.

This mod also has support for almost all modded conduits as well.
